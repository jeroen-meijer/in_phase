- NEVER run these commands yourself, always ask for permission: `sync`, `crawl`, etc. You cannot run these since they are expensive API calls and we want to avoid hitting rate limits. Instead, if you want to assert or test some behavior, make a script or config to do so that doesn't call APIs too often (but up to 50 or so times is fine).
- NEVER clear the cache for crawl or sync yourself, always ask for permission.
- NEVER run a command or custom script that may delete data from Spotify or especially Rekordbox.
